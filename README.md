CVE Miner
=========

Python script to mine CVEs from git projects and create some statisctisc about them.

## Requrements
    > PostgreSQL
    > Airtable

Currently the tool optinally stores mined data in a predetermined airtable.
The data needed to identify cve-s is stored in a Postrge database, therefore it is also needed for usage.

## Usage
The script is intended to be used in order to mine a git repository. This repository can should be accessable both by local paths and git checkout links. 

It is also possible to mine a set of projects from a json file. The file should contain a list of dictionaries, each of which needs to have a url string key, that holds the api path to the repo.
    
## Json example:
    > [{
    >"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/django/django",
    >"something": "123" ...
    >}, ... ]

### Usage examples:
    > cve_miner  -o https://github.com/someone/something.git
    > cve_miner  -l /home/username/gitrepo

### To download and store CVEs in csv files:
    > cve_miner -d

### To create a PostgreSQL databse:
    > cve_miner -db

### Optional arguments:
    > Since the tool uses both a local and a cload database, and is designed to be able to mine more then one project at a time, it is possible to save the postgre password and the airtable api key. Otherwise these will be requested for every project that is being mined.
    > The mined data is currenctly being stored in an airtable, to access this you will need an api key, by default only a local stats.json will be created

The output data will be stored in a json file, and multiple files with various statistics should be created.
