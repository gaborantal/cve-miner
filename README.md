CVE Miner
=========

Python script to mine CVEs from git projects and create some statisctisc about them.

## Usage
The script is intended to be used in order to mine a git repository. This repository can should be accessable both by local paths and git checkout links.

### Usage examples:
    > cve_miner https://github.com/someone/something.git
    > cve_miner /home/username/gitrepo

### To download and store CVEs in csv files:
    > cve_miner -s [-i directory for CVEs] [-r directory for csv files]

### To create a PostgreSQL databse:
    > cve_miner -db <database_name> [-r directory of the cvs files] [-u user to connect to the database] [-ow owner of the database] [-ps password of the user] [-h the host of the server]

The output data will be stored in a json file, and multiple files with various statistics should be created.
